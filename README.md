# Sort Visualization with SFML

This project visualizes the Quick Sort algorithm using the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML). The visualization displays an array of bars representing numerical values, which are sorted in real-time, allowing users to observe the inner workings of the sorting algorithm.

## Features

- **Real-time Visualization**: Watch as the Quick Sort algorithm sorts an array of numbers.
- **Dynamic Bar Heights**: Each bar represents a value in the array, with heights corresponding to their values.
- **Adjustable Speed**: Control the speed of the sorting animation by modifying the `VISUALIZATION_DELAY_MS` constant in the code.

## Requirements

- C++ Compiler
- [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) library

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sort-visualization-sfml.git
   cd sort-visualization-sfml
