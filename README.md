# Sort Algorithm Visualization

This project visualizes various sorting algorithms using the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML). Currently, it implements the Quick Sort algorithm, allowing users to observe how sorting algorithms work in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-time Visualization**: Watch as the Quick Sort algorithm sorts an array of numbers.
- **Dynamic Bar Heights**: Each bar represents a value in the array, with heights corresponding to their values.
- **Adjustable Speed**: Control the speed of the sorting animation by modifying the `VISUALIZATION_DELAY_MS` constant in the code.

## Requirements

- C++ Compiler
- [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) library

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AhmedSamyMousa/Sort-Algorithm-Visualization.git
   cd Sort-Algorithm-Visualization
